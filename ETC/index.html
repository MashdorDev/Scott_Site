        This math library is aimed at providing an understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts and their implementation
        in code, using the latest standard C++ protocols and techniques. It is intended for educational purposes and for those
        who wish to gain insight into the inner workings of mathematical functions. However,
        it should be noted that if you are working on a professional project, it is recommended to use a more established
        and optimized library such as GLM, which is a widely accepted industry standard.
    </p>
    <p>
        The code in this library has been tested against GLM and is known to function correctly. However, it should be
        acknowledged that GLM may offer better performance in certain cases, but its source code can be challanging 
        to comprehend without a specialized background in mathematics and advanced C++ templates.
    </p>
    <p>
        The library is written as header-only, which has several benefits. Firstly, it simplifies the process of
        incorporating the library into other projects by eliminating the need for separate compilation or linking.
        Instead, the user only needs to include the appropriate header files in their own source code,
        providing ease of use and flexibility.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, header-only libraries are highly portable, as they do not depend on pre-built binaries or 
        object files. This allows the library to be used on any platform without the need for separate builds or
        special configurations, and also eliminates potential runtime issues caused by differences between the
        library's build environment and the application's runtime environment.
     </p>
    <p>
        However, one of the downsides of header-only libraries is that they may increase compilation time.
        The functions and classes are defined within the header files, which means that the compiler will process
        them every time the header is included, resulting in longer build times. Additionally, the increased size
        of the source files can cause memory issues when working with very large projects.

    <p>Inlining, as a feature of C/C++, is used often in this library. One of the main advantages is that it reduces
    the overhead of function calls. When a function is called, the program must perform a number of operations such
    as pushing arguments onto the stack, performing a jump to the function's address, and then cleaning up the stack
    after the function returns. When a function is inlined, the code of the function is replaced by the code of the
    function at the point where the function is called, thus eliminating the need for these operations and reducing
    the overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another advantage of inlining is that it can improve the performance of the program by increasing the opportunities
        for the compiler to perform optimizations. When the code of a function is visible to the compiler, it can 
        perform more accurate and extensive analysis and optimization of the code, which can lead to better performance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, inlining can also be beneficial for readability and maintainability of the code. By inlining small, 
        simple functions, the code becomes more self-explanatory and can be more easily understood by developers.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, it is important to note that inlining can also have some downsides, such as increasing the size of the
        generated code and making the code less debuggable as the program counter does not move to the inlined function.
        Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of inlining when considering
        whether to use it in a particular case.

        Just for the smile, this is my C version of the library from 1986. C++ was anounced in 1985 by Bjarne Stroustrup
        but I had just started to code seriously in C.<br />
