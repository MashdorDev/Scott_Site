    <H1> Welcome to Game 309 - Game Engines 5 </H1>
    <p>In this course, we will cover approximately 10-12 topics at a rate of one per week.
    I will give you 10% of your grade for each topic that you demonstrate strong knowledge in.
    As you are in your final year, I hope that you will apply these ideas in your
    capstone project so that you do not have to create separate demonstration programs.
    The goal is to make your capstone project stand out.</p>

    <p>As each topic is worth 10%, you can choose how many of these ideas you want to implement.
    Therefore, you have the opportunity to choose your own grade by demonstrating
    strong knowledge in the number of topics that you select.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Topic 1 (max 10%): Memory Monitor<br />
                For full credit, keep track of all the heap allocations and deallocations by overloading
                the new and delete operators and gather data.
                Some ideas are, but not limited to, count the number of allocations and deallocations,
                sum the amount mem allocated and subtrack the amount deallocated looking for memory leaks.
                Can you give me some statistics about memory allocation and deallocation I can use

                Topic 2 (max 10%): Memory Management<br />
                Memory management in game programming is the process of allocating, freeing and managing memory efficiently to ensure the
                proper execution of a game. This includes handling memory allocation for game assets such as textures, audio files,
                and models, as well as managing memory used by the game engine and game objects. Effective memory management is crucial
                for achieving optimal performance, avoiding crashes in large game productions. Common techniques used in game memory management
                include pooling, garbage collection, distinct memory block allocations.
                <a class="nav" href="MemoryMonitor.zip"> Example code improved: MemoryManager </a><br />
                To get full credit for this topic, put the memory management tecgniques discussed in class into an existing program
                and demonstrate that you can control the use of memory over just using the OS.

                Topic 3 (max 10%): C++ Concurrency <i>(multi-threading)</i><br />
                For full credit, the secondary threads must perform a meaningful task.
                If the threads share objects in memory, the use of <code>mutexes</code>
                (a synchronization object) should be considered to prevent race conditions.
                Here are some ideas for tasks that the secondary threads could perform:
            </p>
        </li>
            
    <ul>
    <li>Loading assets for a graphical game</li>
    <li>Monitoring XInput for a gaming application</li>
    <li>Running a GUI interface</li>
    <li>Monitoring UDP network data</li>
     </ul>

            <p>
                Feel free to be creative and think of other tasks that the secondary threads could perform.<br />

                    Topic 5 (10%): Audio <br />
                    Creating audio without tools is very difficult and requires a knowledge of 3D-audio physics beyond the scope of out program.<br />
                    Therefore, I recommend using a pre-made library:<br />

                    <a href="https://https://www.ambiera.com/irrklang/"> IrrKlang </a> This is my favorite library. It's very complete, I'll demo it in class<br /><br />

                    <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/"> SDL_mixer </a> This is a primitive audio library that cannot handle too many audio clips being played at the same time but it's easy to use and great for backgound music.As you may know, Limbo is my favorite
                    video game from my grogramming and artistic perspective. I love the background music so much, I bought it, check it out in the panel on the right. <br /><br />

                    <a href="https://www.openal.org/"> OpenAl - Open Audio Library </a> This offers more features than SDL_mixer. It is free and open source (and a little old) - I dare you to look into it. <br /><br />
                    <a href="https://www.fmod.com/"> FMod - FMOD is a proprietary sound effects engine developed by Firelight Technologies </a> This is very much one of the standards in gaming. To download it you must register with them,
                    to use it commercially, you must pay them. It is very complete for 3D sounds and music. It can hook into Unity, Unreal or in your stand-alone applications. Warning: it is a big API, there is a large learning curve associated with it. <br />
                    Sorry, the video failed, there was no audio for the Audio class.<br /> <br />

                Topic 6 (10%): GUI build your own or use a pre-made tool kit.<br />

                Topic 7 (10%): Frustum Culling <br />
                In any graphics API, all the actors are passed into the shading pipeline. Vertex after vertex are transformed by the ProjectMatrix -> ViewMatrix ->
                ModelMatrix sequence forming primitives like triangles. At the end of all the calculations, if what you are drawing is outside of the window the data is
                clipped (just thown away).<br />

                What if you knew that Mario was behind you and not in front of the camera? You could save a lot of processing time by just not drawing Mario at all.
                This is the idea of frustrum culling. <br />

                Topic 8 (20% It's hard to do): Abstracting the Renderer <br />
                There are many renderering APIs out there: DirectX 11, DirectX 12, OpenGL and Vulkan. How do you choose what type of renderer you should use?
                That will be the subject of this talk. Maybe the best appoach is to abstract the renderer and we could use and choose any of them at start of runtime.<br />

                Topic 9 (10%): Profiling Tools <br />

                Profiling tools are already installed since VS2019. Let me show you a little on geting started analyzing your C# or C++ code. Yup, I said C#.<br />
                There's technical publications from Microsoft out there on how to use their profiling (diagnostics report) tools but I find them unclear. There are a set
                of (pretty bad) videos from Microsoft on YouTube, but in my opinion, they talk a lot and say very little. Just skip to this link
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1-uHpEqNGM&list=PLReL099Y5nRf2cOurn1hI-gSRxsdbC27C&index=4">Profiling CPU usage</a> <br />
                Use these tools look at what your capstone is doing over time.<br />
                Another way to do timing is to do it yourself. In the online version of the class, I talked about std::chrono.
                Using this tool, you can create your own timing calls to evaluate the performance of your code. One member of out cohort, reminded me about a fun charactor on youtube.
                He has a game engine series, and I really love his work. I think he steals my good ideas. Ha! <br />
                This guy does a great job of creating some timer wrappers in this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbYV8rRo9_A">Intro to Profiling.</a>
                Warning this guy can really code.
                He uses STL a lot and invokes Lamba functions in his demo, I dare you to keep up with him. This ain't StackOverflow.<br />

                Topic 10 (10%): Unreal, Unity Plug-ins and DLLs<br />

                Plug-ins are nothing more than a DLL written in C/C++ (unmanaged memory) or even C# (managed memory). <br />
                There are two parts the process (1) build the DLL and (2) create the C# script in Unity that uses it. <br />
                I'll show you how to create a dll in C/C++ in class, it's easy, but there is some explaining I must do.<br />
                A very good conference talk about DLLs was at CppCon 2017 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPQWQfDhICA">Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about DLLs</a><br />
