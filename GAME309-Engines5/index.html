    <H1> Welcome to Game 309 - Game Engines 5 </H1>
    <p>
        In this course, we will cover approximately 10-12 topics at a rate of one per week.
        I will give you 10% of your grade for each topic that you demonstrate strong knowledge in.
        As you are in your final year, I hope that you will apply these ideas in your
        capstone project so that you do not have to create separate demonstration programs.
        The goal is to make your capstone project stand out.
    </p>

    <p>
        As each topic is worth 10%, you can choose how many of these ideas you want to implement.
        Therefore, you have the opportunity to choose your own grade by demonstrating
        strong knowledge in the number of topics that you select.
    </p>

                Topic 1 (max 10%): Memory Monitor<br />
                For full credit, keep track of all the heap allocations and deallocations by overloading
                the new and delete operators and gather data.
                Some ideas are, but not limited to, count the number of allocations and deallocations,
                sum the amount mem allocated and subtrack the amount deallocated looking for memory leaks.
                Can you give me some statistics about memory allocation and deallocation I can use

                Topic 2 (max 10%): Memory Management<br />
                Memory management in game programming is the process of allocating, freeing and managing memory efficiently to ensure the
                proper execution of a game. This includes handling memory allocation for game assets such as textures, audio files,
                and models, as well as managing memory used by the game engine and game objects. Effective memory management is crucial
                for achieving optimal performance, avoiding crashes in large game productions. Common techniques used in game memory management
                include pooling, garbage collection, distinct memory block allocations.
                <a class="nav" href="MemoryMonitor.zip"> Example code improved: MemoryManager </a><br />
                To get full credit for this topic, put the memory management tecgniques discussed in class into an existing program
                and demonstrate that you can control the use of memory over just using the OS.

                Topic 3 (max 10%): C++ Concurrency <i>(multi-threading)</i><br />
                For full credit, the secondary threads must perform a meaningful task.
                If the threads share objects in memory, the use of <code>mutexes</code>
                (a synchronization object) should be considered to prevent race conditions.

                    In class I will show you how to build a timer class to get time measurements from
                    inside methods. Easy.

                Topic 5 (10%): Audio <br />
                Creating audio without tools is very difficult and requires a knowledge of 3D-audio physics beyond the scope of out program.<br />
                Therefore, I recommend using a pre-made library:<br />

                <a href="https://www.ambiera.com/irrklang/"> IrrKlang </a> This is my favorite library. It's very complete, I'll demo it in class<br /><br />

                <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/"> SDL_mixer </a> This is a primitive audio library that cannot handle too many audio clips being played at the same time but it's easy to use and great for backgound music.As you may know, Limbo is my favorite
                video game from my grogramming and artistic perspective. I love the background music so much, I bought it, check it out in the panel on the right. <br /><br />

                <a href="https://www.openal.org/"> OpenAl - Open Audio Library </a> This offers more features than SDL_mixer. It is free and open source (and a little old) - I dare you to look into it. <br /><br />
                <a href="https://www.fmod.com/"> FMod - FMOD is a proprietary sound effects engine developed by Firelight Technologies </a> This is very much one of the standards in gaming. To download it you must register with them,
                to use it commercially, you must pay them. It is very complete for 3D sounds and music. It can hook into Unity, Unreal or in your stand-alone applications. Warning: it is a big API, there is a large learning curve associated with it. <br />
