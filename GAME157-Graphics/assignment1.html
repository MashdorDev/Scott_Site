            <H1> Assignment 1 - Scene1.cpp   (14/20)</H1>
            
            <h3>Using the Phong model of lighting:<br /></h3>
            <img src="phongEq.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="Smiley face" /><br />
          
            <p> Each assignment we do needs to be put into its own Scene. For Assignment1 you need to place it in Scene1, Assignment2
            in Scene2 - get it? There are a lot of you in the course and if you foul this simple idea up and I mark you down because 
            I just can't find your code, that's kind of on you, isn't it?  I will show you in class how to do that. <br/>
            For the first assignent create a minimum of two lights in Scene1.cpp based on the Phong Shading model.
            This will require you to create two light positions in the Scene. Both of those positions need to be
            sent to the GPU as uniform variables. The phongVert.glsl and phongFrag.glsl files need to be copied
            given new names. Those names you can pick yourself. Something like "multPhongVert.glsl" might be cool. 
            Of course, the code inside those shaders will have to be modified to reflect the multiple
            light positions passed by the CPU. I recommend using two different colors of lights postioned away from each other. <br />
        </p>

        <p class="mainbody">
            <H3>For added marks try the following: (Up to 6 more)<br /></H3>
            <ul>
                <li>Extra: Store and pass the two light positions as arrays. The vertex shader will need to revieve the array.<br /></li>
                <li>Extra: Store and pass the muliple light positions as arrays. You will need to also pass the length of the array<br /></li>
                <li>Extra: Pass Diffuse and Spectular colour data from the CPU to the GPU. Using C structs? Ask me. <br /></li>
            </ul>
        </p>


        <p class="mainbody">
            At minimum your Scene1 should look something like this:<br /> 
            <i>Someone is going to ask, does it have to be the Corona virius?</i> No! <br/>
