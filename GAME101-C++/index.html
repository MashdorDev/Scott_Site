    A really good site for C++ is <a href="http://www.learncpp.com/">www.learncpp.com</a><br/><br/>
    Here is a copy of the 2D graphics that you are using in your Physics class with Professor Umer Noor. <br/>
    <a href="../CodeDepot/SDL_Project24.101.0.zip">SDL_Project24.101.0.zip</a><br/>
    </div>

      <H4> Let's chat about the graphics framework you will be working with for the next 2.5 years. </H4><br/>

            <p>
                Topic 0: Polymorphism <br />
                Inheritance<br/>
                Private, public and protected<br/>
                Virural methods (way easier that it sounds)<br/>
                Absract methods (way easier that it sounds)<br/>
                Pure virtual functions (again, the words sound scary, it's easier than it sounds)<br/>

                Topic 1: Bits & Bytes <br />
                Counting in bases: Base-10 (humans), Base-8 (octopi), Hexidecimal (real progammers) and Binary (computers)<br/>
                Arithmetic varius bases, it all works <br/>
                Logic gates: AND, OR, XOR<br/>
                Unsigned vs. Signed integers<br/>

                Topic 2: SDL_Events <br />
                Picking objects with the mouse using events and in the inverse projection matrix<br/>
                Positioning objects with the mouse. <br/>
                Throwing an object. <br/>

             <p>
                Topic 3: IEEE floating point <br />
                We tend to work in floating point math, vectors, and matricies. You kinda need to know how it works.
                Why I want you to append floats with "f" e.g. 3.141592654f<br/>
                Why there are the same number of numbers between 0 and 1 than between 10 and 100 <br/>
                How is a float layed out in memory, you don't need to memorize it just admit you heard about it <br/>

               Topic 4: Collisions <br />
               There are two topics burried in this: <br/>
               1) Collision detection<br/>
               2) Collision responce<br/> 
               <a href="../ChalkTalk/collisions.png">Math that Umer will tell you about next semester </a> <br/>
                How two ball's collide in one demention <br />

      <h2>Dina's last assignment (worth 25 arbitrary marks) </h2><br/>
      <p> So far I have shown you how to draw a ball on the screen, bounce the ball off the floor, and grab the ball with
          the mouse. I want you to show off to me how well your programming skills are progressing, be bold.<br/>
          My assignment is that you write something you think is fun. Like flick a ball and hit a target, or flick a ball and hit
          another ball and bounce off it. Maybe spawn many balls with mouse clicks and have them all bounce of the floor 
          and how about bouncing off the walls as well. Flick the ball into a basket and detect that it went in basket ball. 
          Shoot it into a net - soccer, do it fast - hockey. Wait, flick the ball into a target and the image changes
          to a little heart - ahhh. <br/> 
    </p>

    <p> I'll make up a grading scheme as soom as I figure out what stuff
        I can show you in the next few classes. 
        In the mean time have fun and play with the code.
        </p>
