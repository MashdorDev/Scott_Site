First step is to get Visual Sudio 19 Community installed. In this video I'll walk you through it.<br/>

<b>Assignment1:</b> Create a Scene1 (not Scene0) where there are two images one is flappy bird and the other is a cliff. Place flappy bird 
at the top of the cliff and have him fall to the ground. Use the starting values Umer gave you in the Physics class. Feel free to scale the cliff and/or
Flappy and adjust the orthographic matrix if you wish. (8/10) <br/>
Extra: Use a keyboard sdl_event to start the simulation. Use any key you wish.  (1/10) <br/>
Extra: Launch Flappy with +vel on the x-axis but when Fappy hits the ground forward vel must stop.(1/10) <br/><br/>  

<b>Assignment2: </b> Create a Scene2 and roll a boulder across the bottom of the screen. Really, the ball just has a velocity but by rotating the image 
as the ball slides it gives the impression that the ball is actually rolling. To calculate the the angle of the ball based on the linear velocity,
use the following code in Update(...), the radius of the boulder image is 1.4 units (8/10)<br/><br/>
<textarea class="code" spellcheck="false" rows=5>

	float radiansToDegrees = (360.0f / 2.0f * M_PI);
	float circumference = 2.0f * M_PI * radius;
	angle += radiansToDegrees * vel.x * deltaTime / circumference; 
</textarea><br/><br/>

Extra: Use a keyboard sdl_event to start the simulation. Use any key you wish.  (1/10) <br/>
Extra: Calculate the radius of the boulder in the x-dimension by using the inverse of the projection matrix. (1/10) <br/><br/>

<b>Assignment4: </b> Umer's binary star gravity well. (8/10)<br/>
In this assignment just put the binary star code into its own Scene. I will be looking for proper coding style, use of overloaded operators 
from the math library in your calculations. In the Scene, you will need to change the orthographics projection matrix to better match Umer's starting positions. 
Easy nothing new. Umer worries about the math, I worry about how you write it. <br/><br/>
Extra: Manage the three bodies with a std::vector container - look it up.<br> 
Extra: Pick a grab the Umer's "planet" and move it with the mouse. Hint: Use the inverse of the projection matrix to convert mouse coords to physics 
coords.<br/><br/>

<b>Assignment3: </b> Collisions! (8/10)<br/>
After we all did Assignment 2, the boulder rolling, I helped you get two boulders rolling and do some collision detection. Now we are going
to do the collision response. Crazy math but super cool when it works, trust me you'll love it. Add gravity and let them bounce around.<br/>
Check out this link to the math for collisions <a href="../../ChalkTalk/collisions.png" target="_blank">collisions.png</a>. Don't panic 
it's just math. The math will be worked out in Scene's Update(...). I'll show you in class.<br/>
Extra: Go full 2D, and add gravity. <br/>
Extra: Place many boulders on the screen using random starting locations.<br/><br/>   

<b>Assignment5: </b> Mastering Events and the Standard Template Library(8/10)<br/>
Create a new Scene, in this one I will want you to use the Standard Template Library std::vector (and a few others) and use it to create new boulders dymaically. This will require 
an understanding of templates and the use of sdlEvents.<br/>
Come to class this will be fun - promise.  <br/><br/>
