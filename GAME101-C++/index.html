    A really good site for C++ is <a href="http://www.learncpp.com/">www.learncpp.com</a><br/><br/>
    Here is a copy of the 2D graphics that you are using in your Physics class with Professor Umer Noor. <br/>

      <H4> Let's chat about the graphics framework you will be working with for the next 2.5 years. </H4><br/>

                Topic 3: IEEE floating point <br />
                We tend to work in floating point math, vectors, and matricies. You kinda need to know how it works.
                Why I want you to append floats with "f" e.g. 3.141592654f<br/>
                Why there are the same number of numbers between 0 and 1 than between 10 and 100 <br/>
                How is a float layed out in memory, you don't need to memorize it just admit you heard about it <br/>

               There are two topics burried in this: <br/>
               1) Collision detection<br/>
               2) Collision responce<br/> 
               <a href="../ChalkTalk/collisions.png">Math that Umer will tell you about next semester </a> <br/>

      <h2>Dina's last assignment (worth 25 marks) </h2><br/>
      <p> So far I have shown you how to draw a ball on the screen, bounce the ball off the floor, and grab the ball with
          the mouse. I want you to show off to me how well your programming skills are progressing, be bold.<br/>
          My assignment is that you write something you think is fun. Like flick a ball and hit a target, or flick a ball and hit
          another ball and bounce off it. Maybe spawn many balls with mouse clicks and have them all bounce of the floor 
          and how about bouncing off the walls as well. Flick the ball into a basket and detect that it went in basket ball. 
          Shoot it into a net - soccer, do it fast - hockey. Wait, flick the ball into a target and the image changes
          to a little heart - ahhh. <br/> 

          Better yet, flick marshmellows into a cup of hot chocolate - many marshmellows?  Wow! <br/>
    </p>


    <p> I'll make up a grading scheme as soom as I figure out what stuff
        I can show you in the next few classes. 
        In the mean time have fun and play with the code.<br/>
    </p>

    <p> Ok, I have a grading scheme. This is just a loose idea, if you have better ideas go for it.<br/>
    Warning: If you are looking to do the least amount of effort in the least amount of time, I will identify you.
    This a big money, and a serious business you are learning about, 
    you want part of it then focus and start using your brains.<br />
  
        <ul>
        <li>(5) Be able to flick an object with the mouse. In physics terms, can you impart a velocity to an Entity
            by using the displacement of the mouse, converted to world coordinates (Umer coords) and dividing by 
            deltaTime. There is a lot to this problem to make it seem reasonable to the comsumer.  </li>

        <li>(5) Collide off the floor and the walls. How big is your object in the 
            x-dimension and the y-dimension in world (Umer's) coordinates? <br/> To get full marks, 
            you need to get this right off by a bit zero. 
            If you were in class today I told how to do it. If you slacked off today - too bad. 
        </li>

        <li>(5) Target detection (colission detection). Rectangle-rectangle collision (AABB), sphere-sphere collision, 
            rectangle-sphere collision. Show me. </li>

        <li>(5) Spawning new objects. Use an std::vector to make a list of new objects. Loop over all of them 
            for Update(), Render() and OnDestoy(). <br/>
            Look up const Uint8* currentKeyStates = SDL_GetKeyboardState( NULL ); Might help.  <br/>
        </li>

        <li>(5) Sphere-sphere collisions. I did the starting math again in class. 
            The consevation of energy and momentum, 
            Umer will deal with next semester. But for right now just try to code up the math I have posted on 
            my website. How will you deal with multiple objects all pairwise colliding in a loop (or maybe two loops)?
            Good thing you came to class.
